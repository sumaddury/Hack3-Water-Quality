This repo contains all the code used to program our algorithm and some site features. 
1. The Water Quality Detector algorithm determines whether a water sample is potable (safe to drink), based on 9 different characteristics of water, including ph, solid    concentrations, etc.
2. The map program uses html to code a customizable map into our website.
3. The data cleaner cleans spreadsheets of missing value rows.
