'''
This program uses a Support Vector Classification model to classify water quality as potable (safe to drink) or 
non-potable (unfit to drink) based on 9 different characteristics. Test accuracy is ~70%, can be improved given more
time and data.
Data is taken from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityakadiwal/water-potability
